 		  I started taking piano lessons at a very young age. As a child, I liked to listen to my music and try to reproduce the notes I was hearing on a little numeric piano we have found in our garage. This is how I first discovered my biggest passion in life. <strong>Music.</strong> Growing up, I worked harder and harder and participated in multiple concerts. After making my first step volunteering at a festival, I have been dreaming for years of working in the <strong>music industry</strong>.

 		  I have been an animal - and more precisely a dog - lover for as long as I can remember. They are adorable little creatures that bring unconditional love to your life. I mean, dogs wait at the door when they know you’re coming home. They dance for you with excitement when they see you. <strong>No matter what.</strong> They are so cute. The little boy you are seeing in the photo is mine. His name is Patxi ("Patchi") and he is 8 months now - and not this little anymore. <strong>Time flies...</strong>

 		  I started to do some recipes when I was very young, mostly by helping my parents and grand parents in the kitchen, given little tasks such as peeling the veggies, slicing the ingredients... Today, I love the fact that I can use my <strong>imagination and creativity</strong> while cooking, play with the ingredients and <strong>innovate</strong>. I also like cooking for others and making them their favorite dish : it is so motivating when you see your loved ones satisfied with what you have done.
